  abstract = {Polyhedral water clusters (PWCs) are (H2O)(n) Clusters in which every
	oxygen is 3-coordinated. An analog of the Bernal-Fowler ice rules,
	when combined with graph-theoretic facts about polyhedra, leads to
	a rich variety of mathematical relationships regarding structural
	descriptors of PWCs. These relationships are developed and rigorously
	proved. The emphasis is on relationships involving four structural
	parameters which are correlated with the electronic energy of PWCs.
	Principal results are the recognition of the importance of three
	levels of information in the H-bonding pattern of a PWC; the definition
	and classification of the `F-components' and `L-coraponents' of a
	PWC; a method for generating all PWCs obeying the ice rules for a
	given polyhedral pattern; and a method based on the four-color theorem
	for producing low energy PWCs that have a property called `contiguity
	two'. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	detailed picture of the surface structure of SO2 consistent with
	spectroscopic data obtained by Richmond and co-workers (J. Am. Chem.
	Soc. 2005, 127, 16806). We also found many similarities and differences

	of the classical potential model in reproducing the asymmetric hydrogen
	bonding of water with SO2 due to its inability to account for SO2

	Dispersive and repulsive interactions are described by Lennard-Jones
	sites, for which the parameters are iteratively optimized to experimental
	vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data, i.e., vapor pressure, saturated
	liquid density, and enthalpy of vaporization of the considered substance.
	The proposed modeling strategy was applied to a sample set of ten
	molecules from different substance classes. New molecular models
	are presented for iso-butane, cyclohexane, formaldehyde, dimethyl

	a wide variety of algorithms and the analysis of them. Now in its
	third edition, <I>The Art of Computer Programming, Volume I: Fundamental
	Algorithms</I> contains substantial revisions by the author and includes
	numerous new exercises.<P> Although this book was conceived several
	decades ago, it is still a timeless classic. One of the book's greatest
	strengths is the wonderful collection of problems that accompany
	each chapter. The author has chosen problems carefully and indexed
	them according to difficulty. Solving a substantial number of these
	problems will help you gain a solid understanding of the issues surrounding
	the given topic. Furthermore, the exercises feature a variety of
	classic problems.<P> <I>Fundamental Algorithms</I> begins with mathematical
	preliminaries. The first section offers a good grounding in a variety
	of useful mathematical tools: proof techniques, combinatorics, and
	elementary number theory. Knuth then details the MIX processor, a
	virtual machine architecture that serves as the programming target
	for subsequent discussions. This wonderful section comprehensively
	covers the principles of simple machine architecture, beginning with
	a register-level discussion of the instruction set. A later discussion
	of a simulator for this machine includes an excellent description
	of the principles underlying the implementation of subroutines and
	co-routines. Implementing such a simulator is an excellent introduction
	to computer design.<P> In the second section, Knuth covers data structures--stacks,
	queues, lists, arrays, and trees--and presents implementations (in
	MIX assembly) along with techniques for manipulating these structures.
	Knuth follows many of the algorithms with careful time and space
	analysis. In the section on tree structures, the discussion includes
	a series of interesting problems concerning the combinatorics of
	trees (counting distinct trees of a particular form, for example)
	and some particularly interesting applications. Also featured is
	a discussion of Huffmann encoding and, in the section on lists, an
	excellent introduction to garbage collection algorithms and the difficult
	challenges associated with such a task. The book closes with a discussion
	of dynamic allocation algorithms.<P> The clear writing in <I>Fundamental
	Algorithms</I> is enhanced by Knuth's dry humor and the historical
	discussions that accompany the technical matter. Overall, this text
	is one of the great classics of computer programming literature--it's
	not an easy book to grasp, but one that any true programmer will
	study with pleasure.},

	by the so-called "ice rules" that govern which hydrogen-bond networks
	are physically possible in the condensed phase, we use graphical
	techniques to generate a multitude of local minima of neutral and
	protonated water clusters using oriented graph theory. Efficient
	techniques to precisely enumerate all possible hydrogen-bonding topologies
	are presented. Empirical rules regarding favorable water neighbor
	geometries are developed that indicate which of the multitude of
	hydrogen-bonding topologies available to large water clathrates (e.g.,
	30 026 for (H2O)(20)) are likely to be the most stable structures.
	The cubic (H2O)(8) and dodecahedral (H2O)(20) clusters and their
	protonated analogues are treated as examples. In these structures
	every molecule is hydrogen bonded to three others, which lends to
	hydrogen-bonding topology fixing the cluster geometry. Graphical
	techniques can also be applied to geometrically irregular structures
	as well. The enumerated oriented graphs are used to generate initial
	guesses for optimization using various potential models. The hydrogen-bonding
	topology was found to have a significant effect on cluster stability,
	even though the total number of hydrogen bonds is conserved. For
	neutral clusters, the relationship between oriented graphs and local
	minima of several potential models appears to be one-to-one. The
	stability of the different topologies is rationalized primarily in
	terms of the number of nearest neighbor pairs that both have a free
	OH bond. This lends to the identification of water dodecahedra of
	greatest stability. },

	sum frequency spectroscopy (VSFS) is used here to further investigate
	the mechanism by which SO2 adsorbs to water at tropospherically relevant
	temperatures (0-23 degrees C). The spectral results lead to two important
	conclusions. SO2 surface affinity is enhanced at colder temperatures,
	with nearly all of the topmost water molecules showing evidence of
	binding to SO2 at 0 degrees C as compared to a much lower fraction
	at room temperature. This surface adsorption results in significant
	changes in water orientation at the surface, but is reversible at
	the temperatures examined here. Second, the SO2 complex formation
	at aqueous surfaces is independent of aqueous solution acidity. One
	challenge in previous uptake studies was the ability to distinguish
	between the effects of surface adsorption as compared to bulk accommodation.
	The surface and vibrational specificity of these studies make this

	as well as Of SO(2) adsorbed on very cold ice crystals has been achieved
	for the first time. Single-point calculations at the G3X(MP2) level

	of the isomeric anionic species ([HSO(3)](-)center dot nH(2)O) and
	(SO(3)H](-)center dot nH(2)O). Generally, the water molecules tend
	to stick together forming clusters, whereas the particular sulfur-containing

	strongly hydrogen-bonded. Only when there are more than six water
	molecules are the anions more or less completely surrounded by water

	simulating the aqueous phase, the hydrogensulfite ions are more stable
	than the sulfonate ions, in agreement with various spectroscopic
	observations on aqueous sulfite solutions. On the other hand, at
	the higher G3X(MP2) level, the gaseous hydrated-hydrogensulfite anions
	are more stable than the corresponding sulfonate ions only if the
	number of water molecules is larger than four, whereas for the weakly
	hydrated anions the order of relative energies is reversed. The possible

	a consistent way. The computational cost of computing the total energy
	and the Kohn-Sham matrix is scaling linearly with the system size,
	even for condensed phase systems of just a few tens of atoms. The

	Agreement with basis set free calculations for single molecules and
