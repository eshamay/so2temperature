  abstract = {We present pseudopotential coefficients for the first two rows of
	the Periodic Table, The pseudopotential is of an analytic form that
	gives optimal efficiency in numerical calculations using plane waves
	as a basis set. At most, seven coefficients are necessary to specify
	its analytic form. It is separable and has optimal decay properties
	in both real and Fourier space. Because of this property, the application
	of the nonlocal part of the pseudopotential to a wave function can
	be done efficiently on a grid in real space. Real space integration
	is much faster for large systems than ordinary multiplication in
	Fourier space, since it shows only quadratic scaling with respect
	to the size of the system. We systematically verify the high accuracy
	of these pseudopotentials by extensive atomic and molecular test
	calculations.},

  title = {QUICKSTEP: Fast and accurate density functional calculations using

  abstract = {We present the Gaussian and plane waves (GPW) method and its implementation
	in QUICKSTEP which is part of the freely available program package
	CP2K. The GPW method allows for accurate density functional calculations
	in gas and condensed phases and can be effectively used for molecular
	dynamics simulations. We show how derivatives of the GPW energy functional,
	namely ionic forces and the Kohn-Sham matrix, can be computed in
	a consistent way. The computational cost of computing the total energy
	and the Kohn-Sham matrix is scaling linearly with the system size,
	even for condensed phase systems of just a few tens of atoms. The
	efficiency of the method allows for the use of large Gaussian basis
	sets for systems up to 3000 atoms, and we illustrate the accuracy
	of the method for various basis sets in gas and condensed phases.
	Agreement with basis set free calculations for single molecules and
	plane wave based calculations in the condensed phase is excellent.
	Wave function optimisation with the orbital transformation technique
	leads to good parallel performance, and outperforms traditional diagonalisation
	methods. Energy conserving Born-Oppenheimer dynamics can be performed,
	and a highly efficient scheme is obtained using an extrapolation
	of the density matrix. We illustrate these findings with calculations
	using commodity PCs as well as supercomputers. (c) 2005 Elsevier
