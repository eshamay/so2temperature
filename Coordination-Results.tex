\section {Sulfur Dioxide Bonding Coordinations}

The bonding coordination of the surface \suldiox~was determined at each timestep of the simulations. Figure \ref{fig:bonding-coordinations} shows the distribution of coordinations of the surface \suldiox, by percent of simulation time, across all the simulations for both the cold (blue) and hot (red) trajectories. A first visual inspection clearly indicates the two most common coordinations: ``S'' and ``SO'', followed by the unbound coordination, and ``SOO''. This trend holds at both temperatures. Also, a \suldiox~configuration with bonds forming solely through the oxygens without any sulfur interactions, or any configuration with more than a single interaction the the sulfur atom are rare in comparison to the single sulfur coordinations. These less common coordinations likely form as transitory configurations when the waters briefly move closer or further away from the surface \suldiox.

The distribution paints a likely picture of the surface adsorption process of a \suldiox~first coming in contact with surface waters. Starting in an unbound state, two methods of initial contact are possible: through the \suldiox-sulfur of through one of the oxygens. Because the population of non-sulfur interactions (i.e. ``O'', ``OO'', ``OOO'', etc.) only account for 3\% of all the configurations sampled, either there is a very brief transition state where the \suldiox~first binds through an oxygen and then quickly adds, or switches to a sulfur interaction with the surface waters, or the first contact is made through the sulfur atom. Because the ``S'' coordination has such a large population, accounting for 35\% of the trajectories in the cold systems, and 32\% in the hot systems, it is most likely that the first binding contact to the waters is through the \suldiox~sulfur to a water oxygen. Furthermore, once in the ``S'' coordination, the \suldiox~can either unbind, add a second sulfur interaction, or bind through an oxygen. The histogram of Figure \ref{fig:bonding-coordinations} suggests that the preferred route is to further coordinate through an oxygen to achieve the ``SO'' coordination. ``SO'' accounts for 35\% of the cold coordinations, and 36\% of the hot trajectories. Binding to a second oxygen to the ``SOO'' coordination (7\% of the cold, 12\% of the hot systems) is less likely than losing an interaction through an oxygen back to the ``S'' coordination.

We thus have a likely route for adsorption and binding of an unbound \suldiox~to a water surface. The unbound \suldiox~initially binds mostly to a water through the sulfur atom, and then will either unbind, or add an oxygen interaction to oscillate between unbound, ``S'', and ``SO'' coordinations. It may then undergo brief sojourns to other coordinations because of the motions and rearrangements of the surface water molecules. These brief transitory coordinations are overwhelmed by the dominant ``S'' and ``SO'' states. The most probable deviation from those two coordinations is to the ``SOO'', where a second oxygen interaction is formed. Otherwsie the \suldiox~unbinds from the surface to repeat the adsorption process.

Baer et al performed this coordination analysis for their single-temperature study, but discriminating between \suldiox~binding through the two different oxygens. They concluded that there is assymetric hydrogen bonding through the \suldiox~oxygens, with one binding more often than the other. This is supported by the findings here where all the double oxygen coordinations (i.e. ``OO'', ``SOO'', etc.) represent a much lower percentage of the coordinations than the single oxygen counterparts (i.e. ``O'', ``SO'', etc.). 

%To further assess the effect of temperature on \suldiox~behavior we turn to analysis of the bonds formed between \suldiox~and the water surface. The bonding coordinations were determined for the \suldiox~based on the bondlength criteria noted in the introduction. Bonds formed between \suldiox-sulfur and \wat-oxygen are labeled 'S' coordinated, and bonds formed between \suldiox-oxygen and \wat-hydrogen are labeled 'O' coordinated. For each bond an additional letter label is appended to the coordination. For example, an 'SOO' coordinated \suldiox~forms three bonds to waters: two bonds are formed through the \suldiox-oxygens, and one through the \suldiox~sulfur. This naming scheme is taken from a similar convention used for describing water bonding interactions, but applied now to the \suldiox~molecule.\cite{Buch2005} 

%Figure \ref{fig:so2-bonding-coordinations} shows the distribution of bonding coordinations throughout the set of simulated trajectories for both the cold and hot temperatures. The two most common coordination types are the S and SO, followed by a completely unbound \suldiox~molecule. Bonding is primarily found through the \suldiox-sulfur atom, with higher coordinationsThe distribution shows that the \suldiox~mostly forms one or two bonding interactions with the waters. The bonding of the \suldiox~at both low and high temperatures follows similar trends, however the higher temperature shifts the distribution of coordinations slightly to forming more bonds than the cold temperature \suldiox. Figure \ref{fig:coordination-breakdown} breaks down the coordination distribution to show more details of the \suldiox~interactions.

%The total number of bonds formed to the \suldiox~are shown in the top plot of figure \ref{fig:coordination-breakdown}. The \suldiox~spends more than 70\% of the trajectories forming single or double interactions with surface waters. The center and bottom plots of figure \ref{fig:coordination-breakdown} show the distribution of bonds formed through the \suldiox~sulfur and oxygen atoms, respectively. The sulfur interaction distribution (center) shows the \suldiox~clearly spending most of the simulations forming a single bond through the sulfur atom. This supports the overall distributions heavily weighted by the S and SO coordination types. Looking at the oxygen interaction distribution plot (bottom) of figure \ref{fig:coordination-breakdown}, the oxygen remains mostly unbound or singly bound. By increasing the temperature the amount of unbound oxygen coordinations decreases 10\%, but the increase in the singly bound state is only by 4\%, while the double oxygen interactions increase by 6\% over the colder temperature distribution. Higher temperatures shift the distribution of interactions with \suldiox~to higher coordination types.

%The sfg experiment performed by our group on \suldiox~surface adsorption suggested an SO coordination type based on...\cite{Tarbuck2005,Tarkbuch2006} This was further supported by DFT simulations of single surface \suldiox~molecules bound to water at room temperature.\cite{Baer2010} Our simulations show that the SO interaction type is nearly as prevalent as the single S-type coordination at both temperatures. The colder temperature favors the single bond to the \suldiox~through the sulfur atom more than the high temperature, but the increase in coordination number of the \suldiox~is subtle and does not drastically change with temperature.

\subsection {Temperature Effects on Bonding Coordinations}

The binding behavior of the \suldiox~is altered by changing the temperature of the system, as evidenced in the shift in coordination populations of Figure \ref{fig:bonding-coordinations} from cold to hot. In the cold temperature, the unbound, single oxygen, and ``S'' coordinations are more populated than in the hot systems. The increased temperature causes all the coordinations with a single sulfur interaction or more (with the exception of ``S'') to increase over the equivalent cold temperature coordination populations. We see that the cold \suldiox~spends nearly twice as much time unbound, and only slightly more time in the ``S'' coordination. Most of the unbound population in the hot simulations appears to have shifted to the states with double-oxygen and double-sulfur coordinations. Figure \ref{fig:coordination-breakdown} shows the distribution of the number of bonds through the \suldiox~oxygens (left) and through the \suldiox~sulfur (right). When comparing from cold to hot distributions, the greatest shift occurs in the number of \suldiox~oxygen bonds as the hot \suldiox~has more multiply-bound oxygens (double and triple interactions). The increased temperature allows the \suldiox~oxygens to bind to more water hydrogens than in the cold systems.
