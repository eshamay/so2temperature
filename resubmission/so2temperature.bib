  abstract = {Polyhedral water clusters (PWCs) are (H2O)(n) Clusters in which every
	oxygen is 3-coordinated. An analog of the Bernal-Fowler ice rules,
	when combined with graph-theoretic facts about polyhedra, leads to
	a rich variety of mathematical relationships regarding structural
	descriptors of PWCs. These relationships are developed and rigorously
	proved. The emphasis is on relationships involving four structural
	parameters which are correlated with the electronic energy of PWCs.
	Principal results are the recognition of the importance of three
	levels of information in the H-bonding pattern of a PWC; the definition
	and classification of the `F-components' and `L-coraponents' of a
	PWC; a method for generating all PWCs obeying the ice rules for a
	given polyhedral pattern; and a method based on the four-color theorem
	for producing low energy PWCs that have a property called `contiguity
	two'. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The adsorption of sulfur dioxide (SO2) on titanium dioxide (TiO2)
	nanoparticle surfaces at 296 K under a wide range of conditions has
	been investigated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is used to investigate
	the surface speciation and surface coverage of sulfur-containing
	products on ca. 4 nm TiO2 anatase particles that remain on the surface
	following adsorption of SO2. The effects of various environmental
	conditions of relative humidity, molecular oxygen, and broadband
	UV/vis irradiation as well as sample pretreatment were found to impact
	the speciation of adsorbed SO2 as well as the saturation coverage.
	In particular, in the absence of light, the majority surface species
	upon SO2 adsorption is found to be adsorbed sulfite. Broadband UV/vis
	irradiation during sulfur dioxide adsorption leads to an increase
	(nearly 2-fold) in the amount of adsorbed sulfur species, as compared
	to experiments with no light, and results in the formation of adsorbed
	sulfate. The formation of sulfate was quantitative in the presence
	of molecular oxygen. New surface species including chemisorbed molecular
	SO2 were observed on samples that have been reduced in vacuum through
	argon ion sputtering. The total amount of adsorbed sulfur was impacted
	by surface hydroxyl group coverage and molecularly adsorbed water
	layer. Additionally, comparison of sulfur dioxide adsorption on 4
	versus 32 nm sized anatase nanoparticles showed that surface saturation
	coverages of adsorbed sulfite on the 4 nm particles was almost twice
	that of 32 nm particles as measured by the S2p:Ti2p peak area ratios,
	thus showing an increase in the inherent adsorption capacity of the
	smaller particles. Proposed adsorption sites and mechanisms to account
	for the observed experimental data are discussed. },

  abstract = {The uptakes of gas-phase SO2 and H2O2 by ice surfaces have been investigated
	at temperatures from 213 to 238 K and from 10(-7) to 10(-4) Torr
	partial pressure. These experiments have been conducted in a low-temperature,
	coated-wall flow tube coupled to an electron-impact, quadrupole mass
	spectrometer which monitors changes in the SO2 and H2O2 partial pressure.
	The ice surfaces are formed by freezing liquid water. Unlike the
	uptakes of strong acids such as HNo3 and HCl, the SO2 and H2O2 uptakes
	are fully reversible on the time scale of the experiment and the
	surface coverages are roughly a thousandth of a monolayer at 10(-6)
	Torr partial pressure and 228 K. The SO2 uptakes scale with the square
	root of the partial pressure of the SO2 gas, indicating that dissociation
	of the hydrated form of adsorbed SO2 is occurring on the surface.
	The H2O2 uptakes scale linearly with the H2O2 partial pressure, indicating
	that dissociation does not occur. The uptakes are driven by H-bond
	interactions in this case. Support for these conclusions comes from
	uptake measurements with ice surfaces which were formed by freezing
	either acidic or basic aqueous solutions. Although the H2O2 uptakes
	are independent of pH, the acidic ice surfaces considerably inhibit
	the SO2 uptake and the basic surfaces enhance the SO2 uptake. The
	results in this paper are consistent with atmospheric observations
	which show that both S(IV) and H2O2 have low retention efficiencies
	after supercooled cloud droplets freeze, whereas the retention efficiency
	of HNO3 is high. The uptakes are sufficiently small that scavenging
	of SO2 and H2O2 by ice clouds will not be significant. },

	gives optimal efficiency in numerical calculations using plane waves

	its analytic form. It is separable and has optimal decay properties
	in both real and Fourier space. Because of this property, the application
	of the nonlocal part of the pseudopotential to a wave function can
	be done efficiently on a grid in real space. Real space integration
	is much faster for large systems than ordinary multiplication in
	Fourier space, since it shows only quadratic scaling with respect
	to the size of the system. We systematically verify the high accuracy
	of these pseudopotentials by extensive atomic and molecular test

	third edition, <I>The Art of Computer Programming, Volume I: Fundamental
	Algorithms</I> contains substantial revisions by the author and includes
	numerous new exercises.<P> Although this book was conceived several
	decades ago, it is still a timeless classic. One of the book's greatest
	strengths is the wonderful collection of problems that accompany
	each chapter. The author has chosen problems carefully and indexed
	them according to difficulty. Solving a substantial number of these
	problems will help you gain a solid understanding of the issues surrounding
	the given topic. Furthermore, the exercises feature a variety of
	classic problems.<P> <I>Fundamental Algorithms</I> begins with mathematical
	preliminaries. The first section offers a good grounding in a variety
	of useful mathematical tools: proof techniques, combinatorics, and
	elementary number theory. Knuth then details the MIX processor, a
	virtual machine architecture that serves as the programming target
	for subsequent discussions. This wonderful section comprehensively
	covers the principles of simple machine architecture, beginning with
	a register-level discussion of the instruction set. A later discussion
	of a simulator for this machine includes an excellent description
	of the principles underlying the implementation of subroutines and
	co-routines. Implementing such a simulator is an excellent introduction
	to computer design.<P> In the second section, Knuth covers data structures--stacks,
	queues, lists, arrays, and trees--and presents implementations (in
	MIX assembly) along with techniques for manipulating these structures.
	Knuth follows many of the algorithms with careful time and space
	analysis. In the section on tree structures, the discussion includes
	a series of interesting problems concerning the combinatorics of
	trees (counting distinct trees of a particular form, for example)
	and some particularly interesting applications. Also featured is
	a discussion of Huffmann encoding and, in the section on lists, an
	excellent introduction to garbage collection algorithms and the difficult
	challenges associated with such a task. The book closes with a discussion
	of dynamic allocation algorithms.<P> The clear writing in <I>Fundamental
	Algorithms</I> is enhanced by Knuth's dry humor and the historical
	discussions that accompany the technical matter. Overall, this text
	is one of the great classics of computer programming literature--it's
	not an easy book to grasp, but one that any true programmer will
	study with pleasure.},

	by the so-called "ice rules" that govern which hydrogen-bond networks
	are physically possible in the condensed phase, we use graphical
	techniques to generate a multitude of local minima of neutral and
	protonated water clusters using oriented graph theory. Efficient
	techniques to precisely enumerate all possible hydrogen-bonding topologies
	are presented. Empirical rules regarding favorable water neighbor
	geometries are developed that indicate which of the multitude of
	hydrogen-bonding topologies available to large water clathrates (e.g.,
	30 026 for (H2O)(20)) are likely to be the most stable structures.
	The cubic (H2O)(8) and dodecahedral (H2O)(20) clusters and their
	protonated analogues are treated as examples. In these structures
	every molecule is hydrogen bonded to three others, which lends to
	hydrogen-bonding topology fixing the cluster geometry. Graphical
	techniques can also be applied to geometrically irregular structures
	as well. The enumerated oriented graphs are used to generate initial
	guesses for optimization using various potential models. The hydrogen-bonding
	topology was found to have a significant effect on cluster stability,
	even though the total number of hydrogen bonds is conserved. For
	neutral clusters, the relationship between oriented graphs and local
	minima of several potential models appears to be one-to-one. The
	stability of the different topologies is rationalized primarily in
	terms of the number of nearest neighbor pairs that both have a free
	OH bond. This lends to the identification of water dodecahedra of
	greatest stability. },

	phenomena such as acid rain, climate change, and cloud formation.
	In addition, SO2 is fundamentally interesting because it forms spectroscopically
	identifiable complexes with water at aqueous surfaces. Vibrational
	sum frequency spectroscopy (VSFS) is used here to further investigate
	the mechanism by which SO2 adsorbs to water at tropospherically relevant
	temperatures (0-23 degrees C). The spectral results lead to two important
	conclusions. SO2 surface affinity is enhanced at colder temperatures,
	with nearly all of the topmost water molecules showing evidence of
	binding to SO2 at 0 degrees C as compared to a much lower fraction
	at room temperature. This surface adsorption results in significant
	changes in water orientation at the surface, but is reversible at
	the temperatures examined here. Second, the SO2 complex formation
	at aqueous surfaces is independent of aqueous solution acidity. One
	challenge in previous uptake studies was the ability to distinguish
	between the effects of surface adsorption as compared to bulk accommodation.
	The surface and vibrational specificity of these studies make this
	distinction possible, allowing a selective study of how the aqueous
	properties temperature and pH influence SO2 surface affinity. },

	structures of hydrogen-bond network spanning 12 oxygen atom vertexes.
	Using the Polya theorem the cycle index expressions for 12 vertexes
	and 20 edges of a cuboid in point-group symmetry D-4h are developed.
	A total of 91 energy-allowed fused cubic structures are obtained,
	which are classified by 8 point-group symmetries: 1 D-2h, 2 S-4,
	5 C-4, 1 D-2, 11 C-2, 10 C-i, 1 C-s, and 60 C-1. An energy level

	unique two-colored graphs derived from the distributions of four
	free hydrogens of the cluster.},

	of the tautomeric hydrogensulfite anion [SO(3)H](-) **), and of sulfurous

	attached to these species have been optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p)
	level of theory (DFT). The calculated vibrational frequencies allow
	the definite assignment of certain characteristic modes, and in this
	way a convincing interpretation of published spectra of aqueous SO(2)
	as well as Of SO(2) adsorbed on very cold ice crystals has been achieved
	for the first time. Single-point calculations at the G3X(MP2) level
	of theory were used to calculate the binding energies of the water
	molecules in SO(2)center dot nH(2)O as well as the relative stabilities
	of the isomeric anionic species ([HSO(3)](-)center dot nH(2)O) and
	(SO(3)H](-)center dot nH(2)O). Generally, the water molecules tend
	to stick together forming clusters, whereas the particular sulfur-containing
	molecule remains at the surface of the water cluster, but it is always
	strongly hydrogen-bonded. Only when there are more than six water
	molecules are the anions more or less completely surrounded by water
	molecules. DFT calculations erroneously predict that the gaseous
	hydrated sulfonate ions are more stable than the isomeric hydrogensulfite
	ions, even when hydrated with six water molecules. However, if these
	hydrated species are calculated as being embedded in a polar continuum
	simulating the aqueous phase, the hydrogensulfite ions are more stable
	than the sulfonate ions, in agreement with various spectroscopic
	observations on aqueous sulfite solutions. On the other hand, at
	the higher G3X(MP2) level, the gaseous hydrated-hydrogensulfite anions
	are more stable than the corresponding sulfonate ions only if the
	number of water molecules is larger than four, whereas for the weakly
	hydrated anions the order of relative energies is reversed. The possible
	implications of these results for the enzymatic oxidation of "sulfite
	ions" ([HSO(3)](-) and [SO(3)H](-)) by sulfite oxidase are discussed.
	The conversion of SO(2)center dot 6H(2)O into its isomer ([HSO(3)](-)center
	dot nH(2)O) is predicted to be exothermic (Delta H(298)degrees =
	-56.1 kJ mol(-1)) and exergonic (Delta G(298)degrees = -22.5 kJ mol(-1)).

	in gas and condensed phases and can be effectively used for molecular
	dynamics simulations. We show how derivatives of the GPW energy functional,
	namely ionic forces and the Kohn-Sham matrix, can be computed in
	a consistent way. The computational cost of computing the total energy
	and the Kohn-Sham matrix is scaling linearly with the system size,
	even for condensed phase systems of just a few tens of atoms. The
	efficiency of the method allows for the use of large Gaussian basis
	sets for systems up to 3000 atoms, and we illustrate the accuracy
	of the method for various basis sets in gas and condensed phases.
	Agreement with basis set free calculations for single molecules and
	plane wave based calculations in the condensed phase is excellent.
	Wave function optimisation with the orbital transformation technique
	leads to good parallel performance, and outperforms traditional diagonalisation
	methods. Energy conserving Born-Oppenheimer dynamics can be performed,
	and a highly efficient scheme is obtained using an extrapolation
	of the density matrix. We illustrate these findings with calculations
