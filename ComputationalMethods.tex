\section{Computational Methods}

On-the-fly ab initio molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the QUICKSTEP package, which is an implementation of the Gaussian plane wave method using the Kohn-Sham formulation of density functional theory (DFT).~\cite{VandeVondele2005} The Kohn-Sham orbitals are expanded using a linear combination of atom-centered Gaussian-type orbital functions. The electronic charge density was desccribed using an auxilliary basis set of plane waves. Energies and forces from on-the-fly simulation sampling of the Born-Oppenheimer surface were calculated for each MD step using the Gaussian DZVP basis set, the exchange-correlation functional of Becke, Lee, Yang, and Parr (BLYP)~\cite{LEE1988}, and the atomic pseudo potentials of the Goedecker, Teter, and Hutter type.~\cite{Goedecker1996} A simulation timestep of 1.0 fs was used, with a Nose-Hoover thermostat set at 273K and 300K for the cold and hot simulations, respectively. It was verified that these computational parameters yield a reasonable description of bulk room temperature water when simulating a neat-water system. 

Initially, 10 equilibrated boxes of side-lengths 10.0\angs~, with 36 randomly packed water molecules were used. 5 of the boxes were used for each of the cold and hot simulations. A sulfur dioxide molecule was randomly placed onto the surface within 2.5\angs~of a water molecule centrally located above the waters in the z-axis. A copy of the initial system cubes were then expanded along one axis (z-axis) to 25\angs. The system energy was minimized. Subsequently, the system was equilibrated for 1 ns in canonical ensemble (NVT) conditions. Periodic boundaries were set on the two short axes to form an infinite slab. The equilibrated systems were then simulated for a further 20 ps in the microcanonical ensemble (NVE), with trajectory snapshots recorded every 1.0 fs. The initial 1 ns equilibration trajectory was not included in the final analysis. This resulted in 20,000 time steps of system trajectory for analysis in each replica of the system.
